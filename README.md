# apKS-python
Python scripts for the apKS project

TO-DO

1) Implement random samples other than EPL1

- December 25, 2018: p-value estimation is implemented
- December 25, 2018: KS method for bounded power-law fitting implemented
- December 24, 2018: Semiparametric bootstrap sample generation implemented
- December 24, 2018: Repository organized
- November 10, 2018: Power-law exponent estimation using maximum-likelihood is added (estexp). Choosing an almost logarithmically equally spaced subset of a sample is added (elspd). Estimating KS distance between empirical sample CDF and theoretical power-law PDF is added (estKS). Also, a testing module (test_apKS.py) is added that works in the pytest framework.
- November 6, 2018: Theoretical PDF drawing of random samples is added.
- November 5, 2018: Power-law fit PDF drawing on top of approximate PDF is added.
- November 4, 2018: Approximate PDF drawing is added.
- November 1, 2018: Exact power-law 1 (EPL1) random sample generation is added.

- The apKS project was originally written in MatLab. apKS-python is the same project written in Python. A side goal of working on this github repository is for me become more familiar with interacting with github from terminal and Python.
